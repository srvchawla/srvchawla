# My Human User Guide

## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

* I have a curious mind yet an introverted personality, I take my time to open up with humans and at times that comes off as being arrogant (I've been told :)). But once I open up i can be talkative and somewhat humourous too. 
* I’m very ambitious and driven, but I don’t like to step on others to get ahead. I've always relied on my merit than anything else to step up the ladder.
* I am very confident, calm and comfortable in my own skin wherein I love experimentation, finding things, learning my way and sharing with others. 
* I love learning on the job and I'd like to call myself language and tool agnostic. Technology feels very natural to me being exposed to C++/C, Java and such while growing up, though I've dablled with management too for a while.  

### What drives you nuts?

* Vague feedback or beating around the bush — just be direct.
* Politics instead of productive conversations.
* Meetings without a clear purpose or outcome. I sometimes get impatient with inefficiency or overcomplication of processes.

### What are your quirks?

* I give my 200% to something that feels interesting to pursue, even to a point where I get obsessed with perfecting the small details if I’m not careful.
* I am a night owl. Am most productive when the world is sleeping.
* I overthink a problem statement from different perspectives to make it make sense to me first. I often qoute "Two sides of the same coin".

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

* I value clarity over sugarcoating.
* I may appear quiet or reserved, but I’m just observing and processing — I engage deeply once I feel comfortable.
* I like structure and organization, but I also embrace flexibility and creative problem-solving when needed.

### What are you really passionate about?

* As most of you may know by my Zoom background, I am very passionate about music, so off work you'll often find me jamming or playing with my mates in local venues across the island, city. 
* Fitness/Hiking/Camping
* Technology (obviously) of all sorts but more specifically, I love to learn about new technologies and how they work.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?

* People who have empathy towards others and respect personal committments outside of work. 
* People that like to make work fun instead or just a chore.
* People who take the initiative to learn and figure it out.

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?

* Not being honest, I wish people speak out when they dont agree with me and dont bite behind the back. It is ok to clear misunderstandings, and diagree to agree.  

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

* Just be yourself. Even if it's not pleasant to be around.

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?

* I’m curious about people’s stories and make it a point to put them at ease whenever we interact.
* I frequently reference real-life experiences to challenge conventional thinking and broaden perspectives.
* Though it may sound philosophical, I see conflict resolution as a a learning opportunity, a chance to find a better way forward.

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?

* Slack is ideal, but I also value Zoom discussions to work through things in real time. Being a visual and hands-on learner, I prefer seeing things in action and asking questions along the way.

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?

* Outcome based delivery lol. Anything that has an impactful outcome, i am game. If I understand the why, I'm more likely to be on board with the how and what.

### How do you like to give feedback?

* I prefer the direct feedback. 
* If positive, I'll call it out publicly and to leadership in a variety of ways - sparkle, interactions, nominations etc.  
* If negative, I'll speak to one separately first. I'm not a fan of passive aggressive culture, speaking negative behind the back nor escalations until I have explored all options.

### How do you like to get feedback?

* Whether positive or constructive, I value open, honest, and direct feedback. I don’t respond well to hints, and it’s hard to offend me. 
* I’d rather know clearly what I’m doing wrong and work together on how to improve.
