# My Human User Guide

## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

* I have a curious mind paired with an introverted personality, so I take my time to open up. Sometimes that can come across as arrogance (as I‚Äôve been told üòÖ), but once I feel comfortable, I can be quite talkative and have a sense of humor.
* I‚Äôm ambitious and driven, yet I prefer to succeed based on merit rather than stepping on others. Confidence, calmness, and comfort in my own skin allow me to experiment, explore, learn on the fly, and share knowledge with others.
* I thrive on learning through experience and consider myself language- and tool-agnostic. Technology has always felt natural to me ‚Äî having grown up with C++/C, Java, and similar languages ‚Äî though I‚Äôve also spent time exploring management and leadership along the way.

### What drives you nuts?

* Vague feedback or indirect communication ‚Äî I prefer clarity and directness.
* Office politics or hidden agendas instead of open, productive conversations.
* Meetings without a clear purpose or outcome. I can get impatient with inefficiency or unnecessarily complicated processes.

### What are your quirks?

* I give 200% to projects that genuinely interest me, sometimes getting a bit obsessed with perfecting the small details.
* I‚Äôm a night owl and often do my best work when the world is quiet and asleep.
* I tend to overthink problems from multiple angles to fully understand them ‚Äî I often quote, ‚ÄúTwo sides of the same coin.‚Äù

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

* I value clarity over sugarcoating.
* I may appear quiet or reserved, but I‚Äôm just observing and processing ‚Äî I engage deeply once I feel comfortable.
* I like structure and organization, but I also embrace flexibility and creative problem-solving when needed.

### What are you really passionate about?

* As most of you may know by my Zoom background, I am very passionate about music, so off work you'll often find me jamming or playing with my mates in local venues across the island, city. 
* Fitness/Hiking/Camping
* Coaching
* Technology (obviously) of all sorts but more specifically, I love to learn about new technologies and how they work.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?

* Empathy and respect for others, including honoring personal commitments outside of work.
* A sense of fun and positivity, making work enjoyable rather than just a chore.
* Self-starters who take initiative to learn, explore, and figure things out independently.

### What do you wish colleagues didn‚Äôt do?

* Not being honest, I wish people speak out when they dont agree with me and don't talk behind someones back. It is ok to clear misunderstandings, disagree in order to reach better understanding. 
* Avoid taking ownership or responsibility when issues arise.
* 

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

* "Be yourself, is all that you can do" - Audioslave

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?

* I‚Äôm curious about people‚Äôs stories and make it a point to put them at ease whenever we interact.
* I frequently reference real-life experiences to challenge conventional thinking and broaden perspectives.
* Though it may sound philosophical, I see conflict resolution as a a learning opportunity, a chance to find a better way forward.

### What‚Äôs the best way to communicate with you?

* Slack is ideal, but I also value Zoom discussions to work through things in real time. Being a visual and hands-on learner, I prefer seeing things in action and asking questions along the way.

### What‚Äôs the best way to convince you to do something?

* Outcome based delivery lol. Anything that has an impactful outcome, i am game. If I understand the why, I'm more likely to be on board with the how and what.

### How do you like to give feedback?

* I prefer the direct feedback. 
* If positive, I'll call it out publicly and to leadership in a variety of ways - sparkle, interactions, nominations etc.  
* If negative, I'll speak to one separately first. I'm not a fan of passive aggressive culture, speaking negative behind the back nor escalations until I have explored all options.

### How do you like to get feedback?

* Whether positive or constructive, I value open, honest, and direct feedback. I don‚Äôt respond well to hints, and it‚Äôs hard to offend me. 
* I‚Äôd rather know clearly what I‚Äôm doing wrong and work together on how to improve.
